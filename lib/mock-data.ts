      "Discover smart budgeting tips, second-hand shopping, and affordable student deals that will help you manage.",
    content: `Being a student often means living on a tight budget, but with smart strategies, you can stretch every dollar further.

**1. Buy Used Textbooks & Sell Them Back**
Textbooks can cost hundreds of dollars each semester. Instead of buying new, check StudentMarket, Amazon, or your campus bookstore for used copies. After the semester, sell them back to recover 50-70% of your investment.

**2. Cook Meals Instead of Eating Out**
Eating out regularly can cost $15-20 per meal. Cooking at home costs just $3-5 per meal. Invest in basic cooking skills and meal prep on weekends to save $200-300 monthly.

**3. Use Student Discounts Everywhere**
Your student ID is a money-saving tool! Get discounts on software (Adobe, Microsoft), streaming services (Spotify, Netflix), transportation, and even clothing stores. Always ask "Do you offer student discounts?"

**4. Share Expenses with Roommates**
Split costs for groceries, streaming subscriptions, and household items. Buying in bulk and sharing reduces individual costs by 30-50%.

**5. Use Public Transportation or Bike**
Skip expensive parking fees and gas costs. Most universities offer free or discounted public transit passes. Biking is free, healthy, and environmentally friendly.`,

    content: `Selling textbooks is one of the easiest ways to make money as a student. Here's your complete guide to maximizing profits:

**Step 1: Assess Your Books**
Check the condition honestly - excellent, good, fair, or poor. Look for highlighting, writing, torn pages, or missing access codes. Be transparent about condition to build trust with buyers.

**Step 2: Research Market Prices**
Check prices on StudentMarket, Amazon, Chegg, and campus bookstores. Price your books 10-15% below the lowest competitor to sell quickly while maximizing profit.

**Step 3: Take Quality Photos**
Use good lighting and take photos of:
- Front and back covers
- Table of contents
- Any damage or highlighting
- ISBN number clearly visible

**Step 4: Write Compelling Descriptions**
Include:
- Exact title and edition
- Author name
- ISBN number
- Condition details
- Any included materials (access codes, CDs)
- Course it was used for

**Step 5: Choose the Right Platform**
StudentMarket offers the best rates for student-to-student sales, with no shipping hassles and local pickup options.

**Pro Tip:** List your books 2-3 weeks before the semester ends when demand is highest!`,
